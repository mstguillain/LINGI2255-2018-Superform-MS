Implementation:

-Bootstrap and FontAwesome files modified : why ?
  You shouldn't touch the framework files.
-> It didn't change actually it was only a restructuration (like adding spaces
but no code changed at all). I wanted to read the css but since it is a
one-line file...
  
-Channel config page replaced for LinkedIn : Why ?
If we want to close the Superform app source code, the plugin won't be maintainable anymore.
Specific plugin code should be located in the plugin code.
-> To put a button redirecting to the LinkedIn authentication page. The
config_fields do not give us enough flexibility to do so. Otherwise, we have to
 change the channel_configure.html

-LinkedIn unique config page link : Can we have several LinkedIn channels ?
How can we setup that ? The unique config page link seems to indicate it is not possible.
-> There is no problem about having several LinkedIn channels with different
setups. The unique redirect link checks the state of the return (corresponding
to the channel ID) allowing to setup several channel without problem.

-How is your code supposed to work once the app is hosted ?
-> we'll just have to change the redirect links in the code and the
LinkedIn developer website

-Hardcoded LinkedIn identifiers : please DO NOT store the app secret in the code ? This is a huge security issue !
-> we will load clientID and clientSecret from a file (added to gitignore) so
they will not be visible on github.

-Same identifiers kept in memory: What happens if we want to publish on another LinkedIn account ? 
-> There is no identifier kept in memory. Actually every channel has its token
in the DB so there is no problem about posting on different channels.

-Using the cookies system is a bit weird, but it seems to work. However we probably wouldnï¿½t have done it that way.
-> Using cookies was a simple solution that works. It reduces the access to the
 database and will only be required for the admin not for normal users.
